Here are the keys pressed: 
```cd lab7 <Enter>```
```ls<Enter>```
```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```
```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```, ```<up>```

I did ```cd lab7``` in order to go into the lab7 directory. I then did ```ls``` to check the directories inside the ```lab7``` folder. I then pressed ```<up>``` 17 times 
to get to the ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java```, which compiled all the .java files. 
I then pressed ```<up>``` 17 more times to get to the ```java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests```, which runs
the tester file. 

## Step 7

I press ```vim ListExamples.java```, ```<enter>```, ```43```, ```<enter>```, ```e```, ```r2```, ```:wq!```, ```<enter>```. 
The vim command was used to open ```ListExamples.java``` in the vim editor. 
I then used ```43``` and ```<enter>``` to jump to 43rd line. 
I then pressed ```e``` to get to the end of the word and then ```r2``` to replace the 1 with 2. Then ```:wq!``` and ```<enter>``` to save the changes.

The ```javac -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` was 6 up in the terminal commands history and I used this command to compile the java files. I then use ```java -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests``` to run the tester. 

## Step 9

I pressed ```git add ListExamples.java <enter>```, ```git commit -m "update list examples file"```, ```<enter>```, ```git push```. This adds the changes from ```ListExamples.java```, stages those changes, commits those changes with the commit message, and then pushes it to the repository.
