### The original post from a student with description

Hello,

I've been working on the ```ChatServer.java``` file, and I'm getting a bug that I cannot figure out. When I try to submit a message through the /chat endpoint, the server returns an error message instead of adding the message to the chat history. I've attached a screenshot below showing the error message I received:

*insert screenshot here*

I think the issue is there because of the way how the parameters are parsed in the code. I think there might be an issue with splitting the query, but I'm not entirely sure. Would appreciate some help.
